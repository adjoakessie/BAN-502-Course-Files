## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
ggplot(trucks, aes(Distance, Speeding)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) + theme_bw()

```

## Yes I can see some natural clusters being created here. There are 3 definite clusters, but could also be one more where the speed and distance are both high.

We also scale the data. This is critical for quantitative data to ensure that no variable (particularly a variable with large values, skews the data and the resulting clusters).  
```{r}
trucks_cleaned = scale(trucks) 
summary(trucks_cleaned)
#scale works by calculating the mean and standard deviation of the entire variable, then scales each element by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation  
```

```{r}

set.seed(64)
kclust = kmeans(trucks_cleaned, centers = 2) #run k-means clustering with k = 3
kclust #view results
```
Add the cluster assignment to the dataset  
```{r}
trucks = augment(kclust, trucks)
trucks
```
Plot the clusters
```{r}
ggplot(trucks, aes(Distance, Speeding, color = .cluster)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) + theme_bw()
```
## The cluster on the left has more drivers from cluster 2, while the one on the right has more drivers from cluster 1

Perform k-means clustering with a pre-specified number of clusters.   
```{r}
set.seed(412)
clusts = 
  tibble(k = 1:8) %>% #try from 1 to 8 clusters
  mutate(
    kclust = map(k, ~kmeans(trucks_cleaned, .x)),
    tidied = map(kclust, tidy),
    glanced = map(kclust, glance),
    augmented = map(kclust, augment, trucks_cleaned)
  )

clusts
```

Create relevant objects  
```{r}
clusters =
  clusts %>%
  unnest(cols = c(tidied))

assignments = 
  clusts %>% 
  unnest(cols = c(augmented))

clusterings = 
  clusts %>%
  unnest(cols = c(glanced))
```

Because we are clustering across multiple variables (more than 2 or 3) it's very difficult to plot the clusters in a meaningful way. However, we can look at a plot to see the performance of the clusters.
```{r}
ggplot(clusterings, aes(k, tot.withinss)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() + theme_bw()
```
In the plot above, we are looking for the "elbow". This corresponds to the "best" number of clusters. For this data, 4 or 5 clusters would be appropriate.  4 is the best.


```{r}

set.seed(412)
kclust = kmeans(trucks_cleaned, centers = 4) #run k-means clustering with k = 3
kclust #view results
```
Add the cluster assignment to the dataset  
```{r}
trucks = augment(kclust, trucks)
trucks
```
Plot the clusters
```{r}
ggplot(trucks, aes(Distance, Speeding, color = .cluster)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) + theme_bw()
```

## Cluster 2 is the most distinct cluster as I can see all the driver in that cluster are grouped together. That means with more distance travelled, these drivers were not overspeeding much.
## Cluster 4 is also distinct, but groups in 2 parts on the graph.
## Cluster 1 and Cluster 3 are kind of mixed with each other.
